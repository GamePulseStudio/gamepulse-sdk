## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.0

The v2.0 release introduces significant API changes for improved developer experience:

#### Before (v1.x)
```java
// Old initialization
GamePulse analytics = new GamePulse("api-key", Environment.DEVELOPMENT);
analytics.setUserConfig(userConfig);

// Old event tracking
analytics.trackEvent(EventType.LEVEL_START, EventCategory.GAMEPLAY, properties);
```

#### After (v2.0)
```java
// New initialization
GamePulse.init("api-key", Environment.DEVELOPMENT)
    .userConfig(userConfig)
    .create(context);

// New event tracking
GamePulse.getInstance().systemEvent()
    .category(Gameplay.class)
    .type(Gameplay.LEVEL_START)
    .setProperties(properties)
    .trigger();
```
