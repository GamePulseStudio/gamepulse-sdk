## Security Features

The GameAlytics SDK implements several security measures:

### Data Protection
- **HTTPS Only**: All data transmission uses TLS 1.2+
- **API Key Security**: Keys transmitted in secure headers
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **No Sensitive Logging**: Debug information excludes sensitive data

### Privacy Compliance
- **GDPR Compliance**: Built-in consent management
- **CCPA Compliance**: User data rights support
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary analytics data
- **Anonymization**: Support for anonymous user tracking

### Network Security
- **Certificate Pinning**: Enhanced TLS security (configurable)
- **Request Signing**: HMAC-based request integrity
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Retry Logic**: Secure handling of failed requests

### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Memory Safety**: Proper memory management across platforms
- **Thread Safety**: Safe concurrent access patterns
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure without information leakage

## Security Best Practices

When integrating the GameAlytics SDK:

### API Key Management
```java
// ✅ Good - Use environment variables or secure config
String apiKey = System.getenv("GAMEALYTICS_API_KEY");

// ❌ Bad - Never hardcode API keys
String apiKey = "ga_1234567890abcdef"; // Don't do this!
```

### User Data Handling
```java
// ✅ Good - Validate and sanitize user data
Map<String, String> properties = new HashMap<>();
properties.put("level", sanitizeInput(userLevel));

// ❌ Bad - Never include PII in events
properties.put("email", user.getEmail()); // Don't do this!
```

### Environment Configuration
```java
// ✅ Good - Use appropriate environment
Environment env = BuildConfig.DEBUG ? 
    Environment.DEVELOPMENT : Environment.PRODUCTION;

// ✅ Good - Enable security features in production
if (env == Environment.PRODUCTION) {
    GameAlytics.getInstance()
        .enableCertificatePinning(true)
        .enableRequestSigning(true);
}
```
